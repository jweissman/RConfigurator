=== Welcome to RConfigurator!

--- Configuration shouldn't be hard...

...and loading configuration for your Ruby application has never been easier. 

RConfigurator automatically "hydrates" your application's module constants by walking
through a .yml file. If you've got module constants strewn throughout your project, 
you can use RConfigurator to aggregate these into one place.

--- Usage

To get this going, you just have to require 'rconfigurator' and provide use with the
name of the project and the location of the configuration file:

    require 'rconfigurator'
    Configurator.configure! "ExampleModule", "/path/to/my/config"

Configurator will analyze the file and 'inflate' your module constants using the data it finds there. Let's say you've got the following module constants:

  ExampleModule::KEY = 'value'
  ExampleModule::NUMERIC_DATA = 3.221
  ExampleModule::SampleModule::SOME_KEY = 'another value'    
  ExampleModule::KEY_SHOULD_BE_MODULE = I::Am::A::Module

RConfigurator can create these for you (before you've even defined the modules
themselves!) if you point it to the following .yml file:

	key: value
	numeric_data: 3.221
	sample_module:
	    some_key: another value
	key_should_be_module: I::Am::A::Module


RConfigurator even handles some common edge cases for you, in particular the case 
when the value is itself a module. RConfigurator will construct the module context 
in place just before it needs a reference. 

For a better feel of how this ends up being useful, or perhaps some inspiration,
here's an example of part of a real configuration file for another project I'm working on
(in fact, the same project which 'spawned' this utility):
